    <p>Why hello there! I'm Lynxmic (you may alternatively call me just Lynx). You might also know me under my older alias "solarixtech" if we've got along for a long time.</p>
    <p>This is my personal website which should serve both as a portfolio of sorts, and as a gateway to my internet presence in assembly. I run my own blog on this website as well (<a href="/blog">lynxmic.github.io/blog</a>).</p>
    <p>My pronouns are he/they (I accept being referred to by either he/him or they/them), and my time zone is GMT+2 EET (Eastern European Time).</p>
