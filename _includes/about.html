    <p>Why hello there! I'm <strong>Lynxmic</strong> (but you can call me Lynx). You might also know me under my older alias "solarixtech" if we've got along for a long time.</p>
    <p><strong>I've been on the internet since 2012,</strong> creating my first YT channel in 2013. Using the knowledge I have gotten by myself <strong>on the technology side of things</strong> as a little kid (which happened to become a huge passion of mine, long story), I have started what is now known today as <strong>Lynxmic in 2016</strong>, having been inspired by other English tech channels at that time.</p>
    <p>Since starting Lynxmic, I've continued to evolve both myself as a person and on my passions, and today Lynxmic is at <strong>over 500+ subscribers and growing</strong>, something I'd have never expected (just like other creators at their beginnings!)</p>
    <p>This is <strong>my personal website</strong> which should serve both as a portfolio of sorts, and as a <strong>gateway to my internet presence in assembly</strong>. What you see here should serve as a representation of what I do etc. I run <a href="/blog">my own blog</a> on this website as well, where you can learn even more about me! I don't post often there; at the end of the day, <strong>it depends on time, mood and ideas</strong> to come up with content of any sort (not exclusive to the blog!)</p>
    <p>My pronouns are <strong>he/they</strong> (I accept being referred to by either he/him or they/them), and my time zone is <strong>GMT+3 EEST</strong> (Eastern European Summer Time) - oh, did I mention I'm coming from Europe?</p>
