    <p>Why hello there! I'm <strong>Lynxmic</strong> (but you can call me Lynx). You might also know me under my older alias "solarixtech" if we've got along for a long time.</p>
    <p>I am yet another human being that uses the internet a lot, and I mean *a lot*. I've actually <strong>been on the internet since 2012</strong>, later starting my very first YT channel in 2013. <strong>My other interests/skills</strong> outside of content creation are in (some) video games, web development, graphic design, as well as have a sort of fascination for outside sights.</p>
    <p>As a little child I kept <strong>accumulating more and more knowledge</strong>, both on the technology side of things (which happened to become huge passion of mine, long story), content creation, and... in life, of course.</p>
    <p>Inspired by other niche tech YT channels at the time, <strong>I started in 2016 what is known today as Lynxmic</strong>, currently the channel is at <strong>over 500+ subscribers and growing</strong>, something I'd have never expected (just like other creators at their beginnings!)</p>
    <p>This is <strong>my personal website</strong> which should serve both as a portfolio of sorts, and as a <strong>gateway to my internet presence in assembly</strong>. What you see here should serve as a representation of what I do etc. I run <a href="/blog">my own blog</a> on this website as well, where you can learn even more about me! I don't post often there; at the end of the day, <strong>it depends on time, mood and ideas</strong> to come up with content of any sort (not exclusive to the blog!)</p>
    <p>My pronouns are <strong>he/they</strong> (I accept being referred to by either he/him or they/them), and my time zone is <strong>GMT+2 CEST</strong> (Central European Summer Time) - oh, did I mention I'm coming from Europe?</p>
    <p>At last, <strong>any questions or issues about the website,</strong> don't hesitate to open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Lynxmic/lynxmic.github.io">GitHub repository</a> or send feedback through <a href="mailto:thelynxmic@gmail.com?subject=[lynxmic.github.io feedback]">email</a> or my Discord Server.</p>
